## Changed

**GO/NO GO concurrency + skipped allowlist + CodeRabbit walkthrough ([A-1195](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-1195))** — set `cancel-in-progress: false` on `ci.yml` and `validate-pr-title.yml` so a superseded run cannot mint a false-red gate; replace the blanket `skipped` accept with the branch-conditional allowlist (release-please only); put CodeRabbit's high-level summary in the walkthrough comment so description edits stop re-firing CI.
